## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

When creating a new branch, please follow the pattern: `[category] [number of the ticket in Jira] [short description]`

- `feature`: For adding, refactoring, or removing a feature
- `bugfix`: For fixing a bug
- `hotfix`: For changing code with a temporary solution or without following the usual process (usually due to an
  emergency)
- `test`: For experimenting outside of an issue/ticket

Example: `feature/ticket-42/create_user_login`

### Commits

When making a commit, use the following pattern for the commit message: `[prefix] [description of changes]`

- `feat`: Adding a new feature
- `fix`: Bug fix for the feature
- `refactor`: Refactoring code
- `docs`: Changes to documentation
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.; no code change
- `perf`: Code improvement in terms of processing performance
- `vendor`: Update version for dependencies, packages
- `test`: Adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change

Example: `fix: JSON response structure for get_item route`

### Pull Requests

Before merging a pull request into the `dev` branch, it should be reviewed and approved by at least two backenders from
the team.
